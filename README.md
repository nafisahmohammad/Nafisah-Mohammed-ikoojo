Hi, I'm Nafisah Mohammad 👋

I'm a passionate Software Engineer specializing in front-end web development with strong skills in HTML and CSS. I enjoy crafting clean, responsive user interfaces and am always eager to learn new things.

📚 Hobby: When I'm not coding, you'll find me immersed in a good book—reading is my favorite way to unwind and discover new ideas.
